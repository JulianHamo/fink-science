 # Flux standardization module

 This module adds two new columns for a set of sources defined beforehand. 
 These sources are blazars that the CTAO collaboration want to monitor starting the launch of the observatories. 
 The new columns are the standardized flux (which is the flux over the median flux computed beforhand using archival light curves of ZTF) and the uncertainties over this stnadardized flux.
